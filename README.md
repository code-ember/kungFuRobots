Implement multiple inheritance with Java

## Introduction
In the last video, Interfaces and multiple inheritance, you learned about interfaces and how they can enforce the implementation of specific functionalities and support multiple inheritance. Keep this in mind now as you apply what you have learned!

In this lab, you'll help Toni create a functionality that SideKick or WatADriver can optionally implement, depending on which version of the robot Toni wants to use for that feature. Specifically, Toni wants a protection module named kungFuProtection, where a robot can protect Toni using, you guessed it, Kung Fu. However, Toni has yet to decide which robot should implement this functionality. 

## Goal
Help Toni create a Kung Fu functionality that any robot can implement if needed. Do this by creating an interface to declare the kungFuProtection functionality. Then enable its implementation only in the robot Toni chooses, by having that class implement the interface.
